              <p>My name is Alex Pasia. I am 24 years old and from Saint Louis Missouri. I enjoy rock climbing, snowboarding and many other things. I feel that having hobbies such as those has helped me with getting into coding because I enjoy the challenge of having to keep trying again until it is done the right way. I also have always had a very strong interst in the latest technology so what better way to learn more about technology than be in the tech industry myself!</p>
